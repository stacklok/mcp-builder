"""Type definitions and constants for OpenAPI spec parsing.

This module contains only type aliases, pydantic models, and constants.
No functions — it serves as the shared vocabulary for the spec package.

OpenAPI terminology for newcomers:

    **Parameter** — a named input that travels in the URL, not in the
    request body. In ``GET /items/{itemId}?fields=name``:

        * ``itemId`` is a **path parameter** (embedded in the URL path).
        * ``fields`` is a **query parameter** (after the ``?``).

    Parameters can also arrive in HTTP headers or cookies, though those are
    less common.

    **Body field** — a property of the JSON object sent as the HTTP request
    body, typically for POST/PUT/PATCH requests. In a request like
    ``POST /items`` with body ``{"name": "Widget", "price": 9.99}``:

        * ``name`` and ``price`` are body fields.

    Body fields and parameters are separate concepts in OpenAPI — they live
    in different parts of the spec and arrive at different places in the HTTP
    request.
